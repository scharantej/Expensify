 Here is the design for a Flask application for tracking and managing official expenses:

HTML files:

- index.html: This will be the main page of the application. It will have a form for inputting expenses, a table for displaying expenses, and a chart for visualizing spending over time.
- login.html: This page will allow users to log in to the application.
- register.html: This page will allow users to register for an account.
- forgot_password.html: This page will allow users to reset their passwords.

Routes:

- /: This route will render the index.html page.
- /login: This route will handle login requests.
- /register: This route will handle registration requests.
- /forgot_password: This route will handle forgot password requests.
- /add_expense: This route will handle requests to add a new expense.
- /edit_expense/<int:expense_id>: This route will handle requests to edit an existing expense.
- /delete_expense/<int:expense_id>: This route will handle requests to delete an expense.
- /get_expenses: This route will handle requests to get all expenses for the current user.
- /get_categories: This route will handle requests to get all categories for the current user.
- /get_spending_over_time: This route will handle requests to get the user's spending over time.
